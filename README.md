<h1 title="YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO">Wassuppppp</h1>

<p>
This is my second Haskell project! Just a simple calculator, supports arithmetic, comparison, ints and floats...<br>
Enjoy!<br>
P.S. comparison operators (==,!=,<,>,>=,<=) return either 1.0 or 0.0 in decimal number form!

<h1>This took WAAYY too long to make</h1>

<p>
I worked on this for like, 2 days?! Too long for a simple program like this. But damn<br>
I did learn quite a lot about pattern matching, structuring my functions, types and like, I had fun<br>
making this! The code just "worked" even though I thought it would combust<br>
I'll admit, some parts may look a bit clunky as I don't have that experience yet<br>
But.. It just worksâ„¢
